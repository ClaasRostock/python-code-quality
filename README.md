# python-code-quality
python-code-quality is an example package containing demo code for the Python Code Quality talk.


## Installation

```sh
pip install python-code-quality
```

## Usage Example

API:

```py
from python_code_quality import ...
```

CLI:

```sh
python-code-quality ...
```

_For more examples and usage, please refer to python-code-quality's [documentation][python_code_quality_docs]._


## Development Setup

### 1. Install uv
This project uses `uv` as package manager.
If you haven't already, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv), preferably using it's ["Standalone installer"](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#__tabbed_1_2) method: <br>
..on Windows:
```sh
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```
..on MacOS and Linux:
```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
(see [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for all / alternative installation methods.)

Once installed, you can update `uv` to its latest version, anytime, by running:
```sh
uv self update
```

### 2. Install Python
This project requires Python 3.10 or later. <br>
If you don't already have a compatible version installed on your machine, the probably most comfortable way to install Python is through `uv`:
```sh
uv python install
```
This will install the latest stable version of Python into the uv Python directory, i.e. as a uv-managed version of Python.

Alternatively, and if you want a standalone version of Python on your machine, you can install Python either via `winget`:
```sh
winget install --id Python.Python
```
or you can download and install Python from the [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) website.

### 3. Clone the repository
Clone the python-code-quality repository into your local development directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ClaasRostock/python-code-quality path/to/your/dev/python-code-quality
```
Change into the project directory after cloning:
```sh
cd python-code-quality
```

### 4. Install dependencies
Run `uv sync` to create a virtual environment and install all project dependencies into it:
```sh
uv sync
```
> **Note**: Using `--no-dev` will omit installing development dependencies.

> **Note**: `uv` will create a new virtual environment called `.venv` in the project root directory when running
> `uv sync` the first time. Optionally, you can create your own virtual environment using e.g. `uv venv`, before running
> `uv sync`.

### 5. (Optional) Install CUDA support
Run `uv sync` with option `--extra cuda` to in addition install torch with CUDA support:
```sh
uv sync --extra cuda
```

Alternatively, you can manually install torch with CUDA support.
_Note 1_: Do this preferably _after_ running `uv sync`. That way you ensure a virtual environment exists, which is a prerequisite before you install torch with CUDA support using below `uv pip install` command.

To manually install torch with CUDA support, generate a `uv pip install` command matching your local machine's operating system using the wizard on the official [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
_Note_: As we use `uv` as package manager, remember to replace `pip` in the command generated by the wizard with `uv pip`.

If you are on Windows, the resulting `uv pip install` command will most likely look something like this:
```sh
uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

_Hint:_ If you are unsure which cuda version to indicate in above `uv pip install .. /cuXXX` command, you can use the shell command `nvidia-smi` on your local system to find out the cuda version supported by the current graphics driver installed on your system. When then generating the `uv pip install` command with the wizard from the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), select the cuda version that matches the major version of what your graphics driver supports (major version must match, minor version may deviate).


### 6. (Optional) Activate the virtual environment
When using `uv`, there is in almost all cases no longer a need to manually activate the virtual environment. <br>
`uv` will find the `.venv` virtual environment in the working directory or any parent directory, and activate it on the fly whenever you run a command via `uv` inside your project folder structure:
```sh
uv run <command>
```

However, you still _can_ manually activate the virtual environment if needed.
When developing in an IDE, for instance, this can in some cases be necessary depending on your IDE settings.
To manually activate the virtual environment, run one of the "known" legacy commands: <br>
..on Windows:
```sh
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
..on Linux:
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 7. Install pre-commit hooks
The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the project root directory contains a configuration for pre-commit hooks.
To install the pre-commit hooks defined therein in your local git repository, run:
```sh
uv run pre-commit install
```

All pre-commit hooks configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` will now run each time you commit changes.

pre-commit can also manually be invoked, at anytime, using:
```sh
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To skip the pre-commit validation on commits (e.g. when intentionally committing broken code), run:
```sh
uv run git commit -m <MSG> --no-verify
```

To update the hooks configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to their newest versions, run:
```sh
uv run pre-commit autoupdate
```

### 8. Test that the installation works
To test that the installation works, run pytest in the project root folder:
```sh
uv run pytest
```
